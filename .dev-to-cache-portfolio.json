Before he moved into mediation, Mike's company was known as Wallis Consultancy, a financial claims management company which he ran from his home.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/s10wb4hqhr5xu7pbnmjw.png\" alt=\"Wallis Family Mediation home page\">\n  <figcaption>The home page</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>Task</h2>\n<p>The original Wallis Consultancy website was made in around 2010. Mike wanted me to revamp and update his website to bring it to the standard of his competitors, and to provide a better user experience which in turn would generate him more business. After discussing design with him, it was apparent that he wanted the website to be clear, well laid out and easy to maintain. In addition, he wanted to be able to edit and create pages so that he wouldn't need to rely on me to make changes - a pain-point with his old website.</p>\n<p>I conducted some research on other competitor's websites and after receiving the consent to proceed with the design from Mike, I began work on the project. Originally I rebuilt the Wallis Consultancy website over the summer of 2016 using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 3, but in 2020, I rewrote it from scratch once again using cutting-edge technologies such as Next.js and Tailwind CSS. I documented my process recreating Wallis Consultancy as a modern Next.js static site as <a href=\"https://wallis.dev/blog/wallis-consultancy-rebuild-intro\">a series of articles on my blog</a>.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ip01inkujuzj85ccakrx.png\" alt=\"The about Mike page\">\n  <figcaption>The about Mike page</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>Technical Details</h2>\n<p>The website for Wallis Family Mediation is written using the React framework <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\">Next.js</a>, which enables functionality such as generating static websites, and <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">Tailwind CSS</a> for styling. Combining these technologies allowed me to build the website efficiently whilst maintaining a well-written React app. Each page of the website is dynamically created at build time from Markdown files using <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching\">Next.js dynamic routes and the <code>getStaticPaths</code> function</a>. In addition, I used two external Next.js plugins called <a href=\"https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo\">next-seo</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/cyrilwanner/next-optimized-images\">next-optimized-images</a> to ensure that the website has good SEO and all images are compressed and resized to make the page load time as fast as possible. The contact form is powered by <a href=\"https://www.emailjs.com/\">EmailJS</a> and uses reCaptcha to stop spam mail. Finally, I added <a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/\">Netlify CMS</a> so that Mike can make his own changes to the website. Netlify CMS uses Markdown files so it integrates seamlessly with the existing Markdown pages utilised.</p>\n<p>If you want to learn more about how I developed Wallis Consultancy, take a look at the following articles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.to/jameswallis/modernising-an-existing-bootstrap-website-using-next-js-and-tailwind-css-c2g\">Introducing the project</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.to/jameswallis/using-tailwind-css-google-fonts-and-react-icons-with-a-next-js-application-50l5\">Setting up Tailwind CSS, Google Fonts and React Icons with Next.js</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.to/jameswallis/using-emailjs-with-captcha-verification-in-a-next-js-application-1g1g\">Using EmailJS to run the contact form</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.to/jameswallis/seo-and-image-optimization-with-next-js-23m9\">Adding SEO and Image Optimisation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.to/jameswallis/deploying-a-next-js-app-to-github-pages-24pn\">Deploying a Next.js static site onto GitHub Pages</a> but honestly <a href=\"https://dev.to/jameswallis/deploying-a-next-js-project-on-vercel-in-less-than-three-minutes-with-a-custom-domain-568o\">just use Vercel</a> (they're both free)</li>\n</ol>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/j181cmkb7xqluvwsx5x8.gif\" alt=\"Wallis Family Mediation contact form submission\">\n  <figcaption>The contact form submission using EmailJS</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/james-wallis/wallisconsultancy\">The source code for Wallis Family Mediation (Wallis Consultancy) is available on GitHub.</a></p>\n"},{"title":"Blockbreaker","description":"A Python program based on the classic Brickbreaker game created as a competition entry during my first year at university.

To compete, we had to extend one of two base programs into a game. At the time I had only been programming for half a semester, so it appeared to be the perfect opportunity to develop software outside of university coursework. My entry was titled \"Blockbreaker\", a re-implementation of the classic game Brickbreaker. The competition was a success and I won first place ðŸ¥‡.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/4kpsddmis5abx144yrim.png\" alt=\"Blockbreaker game screen\">\n  <figcaption>Game screen</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>Original brief</h2>\n<p>This is an individual competition â€“ group entries are not allowed. Use only Python and the graphics module. Don't write (object-oriented) classes and do not use non-standard libraries such as PyGame â€“ any modules you use apart from John Zelle's <code>graphics.py</code> must be part of the standard Python 3 distribution. However, if you want to add sound, I suggest using the <code>winsound</code> module (this only works on Windows, but you can assume that we will use a Windows computer to run your program). Do not re-write the game completely â€“ it should still involve bat(s)/ball or an android eating apples (but of course, it could do other things as well!). Keep to the spirit of the unit and the competition, and make sure that your game would not offend anyone.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/h27v3r8bxobcx9fn4e6u.png\" alt=\"Blockbreaker game over screen\">\n  <figcaption>Game over screen</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>Technical Details</h2>\n<p>Blockbreaker is written in Python (2.7 but works with 3) and is made up of 3 types of components - the bat, walls and the blocks themselves. It predominately uses <code>Lists</code> to keep track of game items such as blocks and score, as every block has a different value. The game is constantly calculating whether the ball has hit any component and determines whether it needs to alter the trajectory of the ball. Matching the original Brickbreaker, when a certain amount of blocks are hit, the game levels-up, increasing the ball speed and altering the colour of the blocks. For creating the Graphics, it uses <a href=\"https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py\">John Zelle's <code>graphics.py</code></a> which was used heavily in University coursework, and a requirement for the competition. It also uses built-in Python modules to read/write the high scores file, control the speed of the ball and randomise the direction of the ball when it hits a surface.
