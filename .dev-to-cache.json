It was, however, the perfect opportunity to completely rewrite <a href=\"https://wallis.dev\">my personal website</a>.</p>\n<h2>Why?</h2>\n<p>I decided to redesign and rewrite my website for several reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I wanted to move from JavaScript to TypeScript.</li>\n<li>The website was styled using <a href=\"https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx\">styled-jsx</a>, which can be a pain to maintain and IMO is a bit messy. At the moment I'm using Tailwind CSS and so far loving it and its utility-style nature; I wanted my personal website to reflect this.</li>\n<li>I no longer liked the design and wanted it to be cleaner and simpler.</li>\n<li>I wanted my blog and portfolio to be loaded dynamically from a CMS rather than having to copy+paste a new page for each entry - See the <em><code>Originally published at wallis.dev</code></em> at the top of this article.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/rs1bvowr8eyxg3gly85p.png\" alt=\"The old wallis.dev home page\">\n  <figcaption>My old home page</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>Technologies used</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org\">TypeScript</a></strong> - Since being introduced to TypeScript at work, I've started to understand the benefits over plain JavaScript.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://nextjs.org\">Next.js</a></strong> - I don't try to hide the fact that I love Next.js, it's so simple to use and to date <a href=\"https://dev.to/jameswallis\">most of my articles contain Next.js in some way</a>.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com\">Tailwind CSS</a></strong> - Lately I've been using Tailwind CSS heavily. To quote their homepage, it enables me to \"rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving [my React component]\". Tailwind CSS also made it incredibly easy to add a <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode\">dark mode</a>. Also <a href=\"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography\">Tailwind Typography</a>.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://docs.dev.to/api\">Dev.to API</a></strong> to dynamically build the blog and portfolio pages ⬅️  <em>My favourite feature</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Using Dev.to as a CMS</h2>\n<p>My favourite part of my website is the use of Dev.to as a Content Management System for the blog and portfolio pages. I've seen the Dev.to API utilised before to display a user's articles on their website but, AFAIK, not quite in the same way as I've applied it.</p>\n<p>The benefits of using Dev.to as a CMS are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Dev.to stores the articles and any images that are uploaded and used.</li>\n<li>I can use Dev.to's editor and the ability to draft an article and publish it later.</li>\n<li>Has a built-in RSS feed that I can use to share my articles to other sites such as <a href=\"https://community.codenewbie.org/\">CodeNewbie</a> and Medium.</li>\n<li>Although Dev.to has the article first, the use of a canonical URL ensures that Google and other sites see my personal website as the source site for the articles.</li>\n<li><del>Converts the article into HTML for me.</del> <em>I ended up rendering the HTML from the article markdown myself, as it required fewer requests to the Dev.to API.</em></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Disclaimer</h3>\n<p>Before I continue I want to <em>stress</em> that I intend to use Dev.to purely for my blog and portfolio (past projects / <code>showdev</code>). <strong>I won't be using Dev.to to create pages which are not articles</strong> and would cause Dev.to to become cluttered with spam if others follow suit. For example, the about section on the home page is hardcoded into the website and if I created a page for my education history, I'd keep that purely for the website and wouldn't post it to Dev.to - <a href=\"https://dev.to/jameswallis/combining-markdown-and-dynamic-routes-to-make-a-more-maintainable-next-js-website-3ogl\">I'd probably use Markdown for these</a>.</p>\n<h3>How it works</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/james-wallis/wallis.dev\">View the code on GitHub</a></p>\n<p>Built using Next.js, the website uses two dynamic routing functions (<a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation\"><code>getStaticPaths</code></a> and <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation\"><code>getStaticProps</code></a>) to generate the <a href=\"https://github.com/james-wallis/wallis.dev/blob/master/pages/blog/%5Bslug%5D.tsx\">blog</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/james-wallis/wallis.dev/blob/master/pages/portfolio/%5Bslug%5D.tsx\">portfolio</a> pages.</p>\n<p>Before an article is displayed on my website, it must meet the two following requirements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Must be published (obviously)</li>\n<li>Must have a canonical URL directing to my website. This enables me to pick which articles are displayed, what the article's path will be on my website (not the post ID). Moreover, an article with a canonical URL pointing to <code>https://wallis.dev/blog/...</code> will be built as part of my blog whereas, if its canonical URL is <code>https://wallis.dev/portfolio/...</code> it will be a portfolio piece.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For every article that meets the requirements, the subsequent build process is followed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>At build time, Next.js calls the <code>getStaticPaths</code> function which</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fetches a list of my published articles using the Dev.to API (<a href=\"https://docs.dev.to/api/#operation/getUserArticles\"><code>/api/articles/me</code></a>).</li>\n<li>Converts the article's markdown to HTML.</li>\n<li>Saves the articles to a cache file for use in the next step.</li>\n<li>A dynamic page is created within the Next.js context for each article - the page <code>slug</code> will be the canonical URL path.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For each page, Next.js calls <code>getStaticProps</code> which fetches the page's article from the cache. The article contains the name, description and HTML.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I also attempted making another API request to the Dev.to API (<a href=\"https://docs.dev.to/api/#operation/getArticleById\"><code>/api/articles/{id}</code></a>) to fetch the page's article, so I could use the HTML rendered by Dev.to. However, this caused build failures as I was making too many API requests at once - so now I render the markdown using <a href=\"https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-html\"><code>remark-html</code></a>.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, the page is rendered. I use custom elements to display the article <code>name</code> and <code>description</code> and then display the HTML I <a href=\"https://github.com/james-wallis/wallis.dev/blob/master/lib/markdown.ts#L19-L29\">rendered earlier in <code>getStaticPaths</code> using <code>remark-html</code></a>. For styling, I use the <a href=\"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography\">Tailwind Typography plugin</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To ensure that the website is always in sync with my articles on Dev.to, I use a <a href=\"https://vercel.com/docs/more/deploy-hooks\">Vercel Deploy hook</a> which is triggered each time I create or update an article using a <a href=\"https://docs.dev.to/api/#tag/webhooks\">Dev.to webhook</a>. I use a Deploy Hook rather than <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-5#stable-incremental-static-regeneration\">Incremental Static Regeneration</a> so that the blog is only rebuilt when something has changed rather than at random intervals.</p>\n<p><em>Note: I use Dev.to APIs that require authorisation as they seem to have a higher request limit compared to the public routes. When using public APIs and fetching each article via the article API, I found that my builds were failing with a <code>429</code> error which is Dev.to rate-limiting requests. - I probably could switch to using public APIs now that I'm using a cache to read the articles from.</em></p>\n<p><strong>I'm currently writing a detailed article which describes in greater detail how my website utilises Dev.to as a CMS, stay tuned (and follow on Dev.to to be notified when I release it)!</strong></p>\n<h3>How it looks</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://wallis.dev\">Visit wallis.dev</a></p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/7apbs7bdr6o1fwiouwc5.gif\" alt=\"Navigating through my website\">\n  <figcaption>Navigating through wallis.dev</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>Future improvements</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><del>Add syntax highlighting to code blocks like on Dev.to.</del> <a href=\"https://github.com/james-wallis/wallis.dev/blob/master/lib/markdown.ts#L24\">Completed using <code>highlight.js</code> and <code>remark-highlight.js</code></a>.</li>\n<li>Add a <a href=\"https://dev.to/jameswallis/using-emailjs-with-captcha-verification-in-a-next-js-application-1g1g\">contact form using EmailJS</a>.</li>\n<li>Only rebuild the website if the content of an article has changed or one is created - reduces the website being needlessly redeployed.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>In this article, I discussed rewriting my personal website from the ground up using Dev.to as a Content Management System for the blog and portfolio pages.</p>\n<p>Like the idea of using Dev.to as a CMS for your blog?

It was even more difficult to find anything that explained how it should all fit together with Next.js.</p>\n<p><em>And so this post was born...</em></p>\n<h2>If you're starting from scratch...</h2>\n<p>If you want to make a TypeScript/Express custom server Next.js project, mine was created by combining the <a href=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/custom-server-express\">custom Express Server example</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/custom-server-typescript/server/index.ts\">custom TypeScript Server example</a> located in the Next.js repository.</p>\n<p>First I created the project using the command <code>npx create-next-app --example custom-server-typescript</code> to create the custom TypeScript server. Then I retrofitted Express into it by looking at the custom Express server example. The resulting <code>server.ts</code> is at the bottom of this post.</p>\n<h2>Why didn't I follow another example?</h2>\n<p>Most of the examples I saw online want you to do something like the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-javascript\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> express <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">'express'</span>;\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> app = express();\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> server = <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'http'</span>).Server(app);\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> io = <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'socket.io'</span>)(server);</code></pre>\n<p>But I didn't want two or any random <code>require</code> statements in my TypeScript code if I thought they could be avoided.</p>\n<h2>My <code>server.ts</code> with only ES6 import</h2>\n<p>The dependencies you need (In addition to Next.js/React/TypeScript):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-bash\">npm install -s express @types/express socket-io</code></pre>\n<p>The code you've been waiting for:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-typescript\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> express, { Express, Request, Response } <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">'express'</span>;\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> * <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">as</span> http <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">'http'</span>;\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> next, { NextApiHandler } <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">'next'</span>;\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> * <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">as</span> socketio <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">'socket.io'</span>;\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> port: <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">number</span> = <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">parseInt</span>(process.env.PORT || <span class=\"hljs-string\">'3000'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">10</span>);\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> dev: <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">boolean</span> = process.env.NODE_ENV !== <span class=\"hljs-string\">'production'</span>;\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> nextApp = next({ dev });\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> nextHandler: NextApiHandler = nextApp.getRequestHandler();\n\nnextApp.prepare().then(<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">async</span>() => {\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> app: Express = express();\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> server: http.Server = http.createServer(app);\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> io: socketio.Server = <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">new</span> socketio.Server();\n    io.attach(server);\n\n    app.get(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'/hello'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">async</span> (_: Request, <span class=\"hljs-attr\">res</span>: Response) => {\n        res.send(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'Hello World'</span>)\n    });\n\n    io.on(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'connection'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-function\">(<span class=\"hljs-params\">socket: socketio.Socket</span>) =></span> {\n        <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'connection'</span>);\n        socket.emit(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'status'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">'Hello from Socket.io'</span>);\n\n        socket.on(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'disconnect'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-function\">() =></span> {\n            <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'client disconnected'</span>);\n        })\n    });\n\n    app.all(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'*'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-function\">(<span class=\"hljs-params\">req: <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">any</span>, res: <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">any</span></span>) =></span> nextHandler(req, res));\n\n    server.listen(port, <span class=\"hljs-function\">() =></span> {\n        <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">`> Ready on http://localhost:<span class=\"hljs-subst\">${port}</span>`</span>);\n    });\n});</code></pre>\n<h3><code>server.ts</code> explanation</h3>\n<p>The main difference between my <code>server.ts</code> and the ones produced by the Next.js examples is the use of the <code>http</code> module to run the server whereas before Express ran it.

Last week I deployed a website onto Vercel and was immediately impressed with the seamless deployment process - even with the knowledge that Vercel is the company behind Next.js. Since then, I've deployed my website onto Vercel and sunset my Digital Ocean droplet.</p>\n<h2>In this blog</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#preface\">How I used to host my website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#motivation\">Motivations behind moving to Vercel</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#deploy\">Deploying a GitHub project to Vercel</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#domain\">Adding a custom domain to a Vercel project</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Preface <a name=\"preface\"></a></h2>\n<p>I first developed <a href=\"https://wallis.dev\">wallis.dev</a> just over 2 years ago using Next.js 7.0.2. At the time static exporting didn't exist and, as far as I can remember, Vercel's hosting (then Zeit) was in its infancy. As a result, I hosted it as a constantly running Docker container on a Digital Ocean droplet.</p>\n<p>My site had been hosted on Digital Ocean droplet ever since. Not once did I run into issues aside from having to update versions of software I was using to host the site, such as Docker and <a href=\"https://traefik.io/traefik/\">Traefik</a>. However, after researching Vercel and deploying another project on it, it was totally obvious that the droplet was overkill, an item of unnecessary expenditure and a waste of time maintaining it.</p>\n<h2>Motivation behind moving to Vercel <a name=\"motivation\"></a></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Better CI/CD pipeline.</strong> Through Vercel's first-class integration with GitHub I was able to move from having to <code>ssh</code> onto my droplet, <code>docker pull</code> my updated image and restart it's Docker container to just committing the code to GitHub and allowing Vercel automagically build and publish it for me.</li>\n<li><strong>Preview URLs.</strong> Vercel automatically creates a preview URL for every pull request you make. Meaning I can send changes to other people for them to proofread and give feedback on changes without committing them to the main site itself.</li>\n<li><strong>No server maintenance required.</strong> Currently I have to ensure that software on my droplet, such as Docker, Docker Compose and a <a href=\"https://traefik.io/traefik/\">Traefik</a> container (reverse proxy that makes the website accessible outside the droplet) is kept up-to-date. Moving to Vercel means I can delete the droplet and forget about the complicated Traefik setup.</li>\n<li>Last but not least, <strong>to save money</strong>. While £5 a month isn't a huge amount it adds up (£60 a year). If I could host my site for free why wouldn't I!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Those are the 4 major reasons I decided to switch my deployment strategy. Now I'll take you through connecting Vercel and a GitHub repository and deploying your site for the first time.</p>\n<h2>Deploying my website onto Vercel for the first time <a name=\"deploy\"></a></h2>\n<p>First, create an account with Vercel if don't already have one. Then navigate to <a href=\"https://vercel.com/new\">https://vercel.com/new</a> - the site that is used to create a new project with Vercel.</p>\n<p>Once you've navigated to <a href=\"https://vercel.com/new\">https://vercel.com/new</a> you should see an <code>Import Git Repository</code> input that looks like the following:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/wq065v0sko16iexzv1tq.png\" alt=\"Import Git Repository screen\"></p>\n<p>You want to select the <code>Import</code> button next to the GitHub repository of your choice. If it isn't appearing use the search to locate your repository:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/tdbbx2d06bib197vfqm3.png\" alt=\"Import Git Repository screen narrowed down using search\"></p>\n<p>Next, you'll be asked to <code>Select Vercel Scope</code>. As this is my personal website I'll be using my <code>Personal Account</code> - If you like you can create a team but beware this costs money! I'd stick to your personal account unless you know what you're doing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/kkxm2tzrr9qursvsrbdn.png\" alt=\"Select Vercel Scope screen\"></p>\n<p>Then you'll see the <code>Import Project</code> screen. Here you can name your project within Vercel and select the <code>Framework Preset</code>. If you're using a Next.js project it should auto-fill both the Name and Framework by scanning your GitHub repository.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you're using a non-standard build command (i.e. not <code>npm run build</code>) or a non-standard build output directory you can enter those into the <code>Build and Output Settings</code> input area. This will advise Vercel on how to build your project and where to find it once it's built.</li>\n<li>To use custom environment variables with your project add them through the <code>Environment Variables</code> input area.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Aside from changing the <code>Project Name</code>, I left all values as default. This is how my <code>Import Project</code> screen looked:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/a830ctjpmgjwbkbc3j5o.png\" alt=\"Import Project screen\"></p>\n<p>Then just hit <code>Deploy</code>! Vercel will verify that your project builds before creating an initial deployment for your website, publishing it to a placeholder URL which will look something like <code>personal-website.james-wallis.vercel.app</code>.</p>\n<p>When you clicked <code>Deploy</code> you should have seen the deployment screen appear alongside the, now greyed out, setup wizard:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/i4rpetnnh9hitbhd6g1t.png\" alt=\"Initial Deployment screen\"></p>\n<p>When the deploy has succeeded you will be greeted by this screen:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/vwliv7jv61etk3yvhaxu.png\" alt=\"Congratulations screen\"></p>\n<p>Well done, you've deployed your website onto Vercel! From the <code>Congratulations</code> screen, you can both visit it in your browser and see it live and also open the Vercel Dashboard to see the live state of your project.</p>\n<h2>Adding a custom domain to your Vercel project <a name=\"domain\"></a></h2>\n<p><em>Prereqs: You already need to own the desired domain name and have access to its DNS records.</em></p>\n<p>The second step to hosting <a href=\"https://wallis.dev\">wallis.dev</a> through Vercel is to connect the <code>wallis.dev</code> domain name to my Vercel project.</p>\n<p>Follow these instructions to do this:</p>\n<p>Navigate to your Vercel Dashboard using the button in the last section. It'll look like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/9akpxtzlh7e5fh5lzpi8.png\" alt=\"Vercel Dashboard screen\"></p>\n<p>Then select <code>Settings</code> from the navigation and <code>Domains</code> in the side menu of Project Settings. The page should look like so:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/h7tk6rw3ni9lcqwfzpw7.png\" alt=\"Domain settings screen\"></p>\n<p>This is the screen where you can add a custom domain to your Vercel project. Using the input box, enter your desired domain name. Then click <code>Add</code>. <em>I'm using <code>wallis.dev</code> but you can use a subdomain such as <code>www.youdomain.com</code> or <code>mywebsite.customdomain.com</code> if you prefer.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/vrib8zsnc8bzcwsg1nsg.png\" alt=\"Domain input\"></p>\n<p>Your domain will be added but it will display an \"Invalid Configuration\" error because you need to modify your domain's DNS settings to point at Vercel. Fortunately, Vercel tells you exactly what you need to do to point your domain at your website.</p>\n<p>As I'm using <code>wallis.dev</code> I need to add an <code>A</code> record to my DNS settings. You can do this by navigating to your domain providers website and you should be able to find provider-specific instructions online.</p>\n<p>If you're using a subdomain such as <code>www.wallis.dev</code> you'll need to add a <code>CNAME</code> record instead of an <code>A</code> record.</p>\n<p><em>By the way an A record uses a domain name to find the IP address of a computer connected to the internet. The A in A record stands for Address.

Google Analytics is great at tracking website usage and more, although I currently use it purely to monitor user count, most popular pages and page performance which is all reported on the Google Analytics dashboard.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/3cew7a2pc9gsnwiq4fyt.png\" alt=\"Alt Text\">\n<em>A Google Analytics dashboard</em></p>\n<p>In addition to the above, it's <strong>free</strong> and takes minutes to set up with a Next.js project (if you follow this post 😉).</p>\n<h2>Adding Google Analytics to a Next.js project</h2>\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>A Next.js project hosted on a domain that can be used with Google Analytics preferably with at least one page. - <a href=\"https://vercel.com/solutions/nextjs\">Vercel (creators of Next.js) is the easiest place to host your website</a>.</li>\n<li>A Google Analytics account with a created property and the ID (known as a <code>GA_MEASUREMENT_ID</code>) that is given to you and is used to identify your website with Google. Keep the <code>GA_MEASUREMENT_ID</code> handy, you'll need it. - <em>I've covered this in the FAQs if you haven't used Google Analytics before</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Add/modify the

<code>GA_MEASUREMENT_ID</code> and pushed your changes into a live environment such as Vercel, you should see data appearing on your Google Analytics dashboard - if you don't, try visiting your website!</p>\n<p>And that is all it takes to add Google Analytics to your Next.js application - told you it was easy!</p>\n<h2>FAQs</h2>\n<p><strong>What does the code above load onto my website?</strong>\nThe <code>gtag.js</code> is a script which allows you to send event data to Google, in this case it's used for Google Analytics. Read more about it and the <code>GA_MEASUREMENT_ID</code> at <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gtagjs\">Google Developers - <code>gtag.js</code></a>.</p>\n<p><strong>What is a <code>GA_MEASUREMENT_ID</code> and how do I get one?</strong>\nThe <code>GA_MEASUREMENT_ID</code> is the ID of the Google Analytics property that you want to collect data for. To get a <code>GA_MEASUREMENT_ID</code> you need to create a new property on Google Analytics - you can follow this <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10269537\">Google Support article to learn how to sign up to Google Analytics and create a property</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the <code>_document.js</code> and <code>_app.js</code> files in a Next.js project?</strong>\nThe Next.js specific <code>_document.js</code> and <code>_app.js</code> are two special files that live in the <code>pages</code> directory but are not rendered as pages by Next.js (you can't reach <code>/_document</code> in your browser).</p>\n<p><em>Note: The <code>Head</code> component used in <code>_document.js</code>'s <code>Head</code> different to <code>next/head</code> and should be used for common code on every page.</em></p>\n<p><code>_document.js</code> is rendered server-side only and controls the <code>&#x3C;html></code> and <code>&#x3C;body></code> tags of HTML. It can be used to add custom elements into your <code>&#x3C;html></code> tag that will be the same on every page such as the Google Analytics code or a favicon.</p>\n<p><code>_app.js</code> is rendered client-side, potentially on every page change. It's essentially a wrapper around each Next.js page that you have. It can be used to maintain a consistent layout on each page, add a custom CSS stylesheet or persist state on a page change.</p>\n<p>You can read more about these on the Next.js website:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-document\">Custom <code>_document.js</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app\">Custom <code>_app.js</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why use the <code>_document.js</code> file over <code>_app.js</code>?</strong>\nThe <code>Head</code> component (from <code>next/document</code>) that is used in <code>_document.js</code> is rendered serverside whereas the <code>Head</code> component (from <code>next/head</code>) in <code>_app.js</code> will update on each page change meaning that the Google Analytics script may be reloaded which could slow down the site.</p>\n"},{"title":"What I learnt using TDD for Advent of Code (2020)","description":"2020 hasn't been great for anyone, but it has gifted me the ability to work from home and reduced my...","publishedAt":"2020-12-23T10:25:35.309Z","devToURL":"https://dev.to/jameswallis/what-i-learnt-using-tdd-for-advent-of-code-2020-14mc","coverImage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--enY4_sOO--/c_imagga_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_420,q_auto,w_1000/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/sm7wdlfj65mqh5u9trrz.png","tags":["adventofcode","tdd","go","devjournal"],"canonical":"https://wallis.dev/blog/advent-of-code","slug":"advent-of-code","html":"<p>2020 hasn't been great for anyone, but it has gifted me the ability to work from home and reduced my morning commute to about 30 seconds. As it's December now, I figured I could use the time I've gained from missing the commute and try my hand at this year's Advent of Code.</p>\n<p>I used Go and Test Driven Development to complete Advent of Code. I opted for Go over JavaScript, my <em>usual</em> language of choice for projects, as one of my goals for the year was to learn it and use it in a personal project. Although I had to pause this due to other comittments. AoC provided a great opportunity to use a different language and pick up some skills!</p>\n<h3>Real quick - What is Advent of Code?</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://adventofcode.com/2020/about\">Eric Wastl - creator of Advent of Code.</a></em></p>\n<h3>Why did I use TDD?</h3>\n<p>Originally I had no intention of using Test Driven Development to complete Advent of Code. I figured that I could log on each day, write a program and submit the answer - because of course my code would always be 100% flawless.</p>\n<p>I found out pretty early on that this approach was wrong for myself as my code, like most, was not always going to work correctly on its first iteration. After attempting the first day and having an answer that <em>wasn't quite right</em>, I decided that blindly creating a program was not the correct approach, I needed to have more faith that I was on the right track before submitting my answer.</p>\n<p>Moreover, if you look at the way that each Advent of Code task is structured, you'll see that it favours a TDD approach.</p>\n<p><strong>General AoC task structure</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Introduction</li>\n<li>Explanation of task</li>\n<li>Example input and output</li>\n<li>Your task and an input file (which you can copy and paste into a file locally on your machine)</li>\n<li>Answer submission box</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The important section for TDD is the example input and output. While their primary function is to further explain the task, we can use them to base our TDD around - instead of using the input we're given for the actual solution, we can use the example input and ensure that when it is used by our program, it always returns the example output.</p>\n<h3>What I gained by using TDD</h3>\n<p>Through using Test Driven Development to complete tasks in Advent of Code I was able to gain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Confidence that my solution was correct\n<ul>\n<li>This was a <strong>huge benefit</strong>, AoC doesn't give you any hints if you supply an incorrect answer so it is easy to get lost trying to find tiny bugs in the program. Using TDD meant that I could have full faith that each function was working as expected.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Less time spent debugging the program.\n<ul>\n<li>You'll have to debug when a test fails but splitting it up makes bugs so much easier to find.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Code quality is improved.\n<ul>\n<li>Each function is better defined as time is spent focusing purely on it rather than the whole program.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Skills in Go\n<ul>\n<li>Learning the language itself.</li>\n<li>Reinforcing how I could both write tests and develop using TDD.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Skills and experience using TDD to design and write a program.\n<ul>\n<li>Obviously.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example - How I used TDD for AoC day 4</h3>\n<p>As usual the code can be found on my GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/james-wallis/adventofcode/tree/main/4\">Advent of Code, Day 4 solution - GitHub</a>.</p>\n<h4>Task overview</h4>\n<p>I won't go into huge detail to describe the task for day 4 and I'll only focus on part 1. I recommend you read the <a href=\"https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/4\">brief for AoC day 4 (Passport Processing) on the AoC website.</a></p>\n<p>Essentially the task was to take an input consisting of multiple \"passports\" (if you are already lost - read the brief) and determine how many are valid when compared to the given set of rules.</p>\n<p>Each passport was represented by these items:</p>\n<pre><code>byr (Birth Year)\niyr (Issue Year)\neyr (Expiration Year)\nhgt (Height)\nhcl (Hair Color)\necl (Eye Color)\npid (Passport ID)\ncid (Country ID) - not required to be a valid passport\n</code></pre>\n<p>The given rules for part one state that each field is required in a passport apart from <code>cid</code> (Country ID) which is optional.</p>\n<p>Some example passports (separated by a blank line):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-bash\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\"># Valid passport</span>\necl:gry pid:860033327 eyr:2020 hcl:<span class=\"hljs-comment\">#fffffd</span>\nbyr:1937 iyr:2017 cid:147 hgt:183cm\n\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\"># Invalid passport - missing hgt (height)</span>\niyr:2013 ecl:amb cid:350 eyr:2023 pid:028048884\nhcl:<span class=\"hljs-comment\">#cfa07d byr:1929</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\"># Valid passport - missing cid (Country ID) but the rules state this isn't required</span>\nhcl:<span class=\"hljs-comment\">#ae17e1 iyr:2013</span>\neyr:2024\necl:brn pid:760753108 byr:1931\nhgt:179cm\n\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\"># Invalid passport - missing cid (fine) and byr (Birth Year)</span>\nhcl:<span class=\"hljs-comment\">#cfa07d eyr:2025 pid:166559648</span>\niyr:2011 ecl:brn hgt:59in</code></pre>\n<h4>Using TDD to solve day 4</h4>\n<p>I split up the task into separate parts like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Read input and convert into a passport</li>\n<li>Determine which passports are valid according to the given rules</li>\n<li>Count valid passports</li>\n<li>Print answer (not tested)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For <strong>part 1</strong> I created a function called <code>ConvertLineToPassport</code> and <a href=\"https://github.com/james-wallis/adventofcode/blob/main/4/passportChecker_test.go#L12\">three test cases</a> which would convert a given string into a passport. Once the test were created, I implemented the <code>ConvertLineToPassport</code> function to read all known parameters (<code>ecl</code>, <code>hgt</code>, etc) and assign them either their provided value or an empty string if they were not present.</p>\n<p>One of the tests:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-go\">t.Run(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"converts a valid string into a Passport\"</span>, <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">func</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">(t *testing.T)</span></span> {\n  line := <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"ecl:gry pid:860033327 eyr:2020 hcl:#fffffd byr:1937 iyr:2017 cid:147 hgt:183cm\"</span>\n\n  want := Passport{\n    eyeColor:       <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"gry\"</span>,\n    passportID:     <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"860033327\"</span>,\n    expirationYear: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"2020\"</span>,\n    hairColor:      <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"#fffffd\"</span>,\n    birthYear:      <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"1937\"</span>,\n    issueYear:      <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"2017\"</span>,\n    countryID:      <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"147\"</span>,\n    height:         <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"183cm\"</span>,\n  }\n  got := ConvertLineToPassport(line)\n\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> got != want {\n    t.Errorf(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"got %+v want %+v given, %s and\"</span>, got, want, line)\n  }\n})</code></pre>\n<p>Once I had confidence that my code was 100% working, I moved onto part 2.</p>\n<p>For <strong>part 2</strong> I needed to determine whether a given passport was valid.

Additional Chai/Jest matchers for asserting that HTTP responses satisfy an OpenAPI spec.</strong></p>\n<p>The OpenAPI Initiative, previously known as the Swagger Specification, is a machine readable specification to describe RESTful web services such as an API. It's used by many to describe what API queries an application can handle and when combined with the use of tools such as <a href=\"https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/\">Swagger UI</a> can make even the most complex APIs easy for developers to understand.</p>\n<p>Using an OpenAPI Specification in your project should make it more understandable and easier for new developers to consume it. It is, however, easy for it to become outdated when changes are made to the functionality of the application, an unfortunately common issue that is present in documentation all over the web. Even the smallest detachment between actual function and documentation can cause hours of frustration for a user of your product.</p>\n<p>In fact, when developing an application which communicates with a third-party API, incorrect OpenAPI Specifications can make it impossible to carryout critical functionality and stop a project in its tracks. I have experienced this first hand when trying to use a certain bank's API to create a money handling application while at University.</p>\n<h2>So how can we ensure that OpenAPI Specifications are up-to-date?</h2>\n<p>Short answer: <strong>With tests!</strong></p>\n<p>Longer answer:</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/openapi-library/OpenAPIValidators\">open source OpenAPIValidators</a> project on GitHub contains two packages that extend both the <a href=\"https://www.chaijs.com/\">Chai Assertion Library</a> and <a href=\"https://jestjs.io/\">Jest</a> two popular JavaScript testing frameworks.</p>\n<p>It describes itself as a plugin that will \"automatically test whether your server's behaviour and documentation match\". It is as simple to use as it sounds, to make an assertion you add <code>expect(responseObject).toSatisfyApiSpec()</code> in your tests, pretty nice.</p>\n<p>In addition to being used to ensure documentation is updated, the testing plugins can also aid Test Driven Development practices by introducing the opportunity to design your OpenAPI Specification first and implement the API second. This means that the team implementing the API will have strict documentation to follow with the plugins ensuring that the correct responses are sent with the correct response codes. Moreover, in a time where frontend and backend development teams are not co-located, both teams can agree on a specification and not worry that one will deviate from the agreed design.</p>\n<p>The two plugins can be found on NPM:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai-openapi-response-validator\">chai-openapi-response-validator</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-openapi\">jest-openapi</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How does it work?</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>You pass it your OpenAPI Specification via an object or by absolute path.</li>\n<li>You add <code>expect(responseObject).toSatisfyApiSpec()</code> to each test where you want to validate the response.</li>\n<li>It matches the request path and HTTP response code returned from the API call with your OpenAPI Specification and then asserts that the response is what is defined in the Specification.</li>\n<li>If the response matches the Specification then the test passes, if it doesn't then the test will fail with a helpful error.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What does it look like to use?</h2>\n<p>Take the test below and the Specification that follows, it makes a GET request, asserts that the HTTP response code will be 200 and then, using the OpenAPIValidators package, asserts that the response from the request matches exactly the OpenAPI Specification.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-javascript\">it(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'should make a GET request and satisfy OpenAPI spec'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">async</span> () => {\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Make request (supertest used here)</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// /hello should return the code 200 with the body \"hello world\"</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> res = <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">await</span> supertest(server).get(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'/hello'</span>);\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Make any assertions as normal</span>\n  expect(res.status).toEqual(<span class=\"hljs-number\">200</span>);\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Assert that the HTTP response satisfies the OpenAPI spec</span>\n  expect(res).toSatisfyApiSpec();\n});</code></pre>\n<p>The OpenAPI Specification used for this test:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-yaml\"><span class=\"hljs-attr\">openapi:</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\">3.0</span><span class=\"hljs-number\">.3</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-attr\">info:</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">title:</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">Open</span> <span

class=\"hljs-string\">World</span></code></pre>\n<p>When the response matches the OpenAPI Specification the test will pass as expected with no additional output:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/kyjifm1rqxt00przl6fi.png\" alt=\"Passing OpenAPI test\"></p>\n<p>but when the response does not match the OpenAPI Specification the test fails and provides helpful output so you can either change the implementation or update the Specification:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/f9d6la5dh8xguh21t0g2.png\" alt=\"Failing OpenAPI test\"></p>\n<p>The screenshot above shows a failure where the actual API response has returned an <em>object</em> rather than the <em>string</em> that is documented in the OpenAPI Specification.</p>\n<p>When the OpenAPI validator fails to match an API call to the Specification it fails with this error:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/koa4rsj2qcm78i4d31yb.png\" alt=\"Unknown OpenAPI test\"></p>\n<p>Which will prompt you to either remove the assertion from the test or update the OpenAPI Specification to contain the new route, preferably the latter.</p>\n<h2>Round up</h2>\n<p>In this blog I've introduced the OpenAPI Validators which can be used in conjunction with Jest or Chai and an OpenAPI Specification to ensure that both your API documentation is kept up to date and that APIs are not accidentally modified to return incorrect responses. Additionally, frontend and backend developers can use the testing plugins to ensure that an agreed API Specification is implemented correctly.</p>\n<p>In the future I will release another post where I demonstrate how the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-openapi\">jest-openapi</a> validator can be used with an Express API.</p>\n<p>Drop me a reaction if this post has helped or if outdated API documentation has inconvenienced you in the past!</p>\n"},{"title":"reCaptcha verification with EmailJS","description":"This blog is part of a series where I document rebuilding a website that relies on HTML, CSS and Boot...","publishedAt":"2020-07-29T17:07:18.600Z","devToURL":"https://dev.to/jameswallis/recaptcha-verification-with-emailjs-29ai","coverImage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QAGAuoII--/c_imagga_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_420,q_auto,w_1000/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/r09vb642f8lj2p13u6rk.png","tags":["react","tutorial","javascript"],"canonical":"https://wallis.dev/blog/emailjs-with-recaptcha","slug":"emailjs-with-recaptcha","html":"<p><em>This blog is part of a series where I document rebuilding a website that relies on HTML, CSS and Bootstrap in React.js using the Next.js framework to improve performance, reduce costs and increase my workflow for future changes.</em></p>\n<p>The finished website: <a href=\"https://wallisconsultancy.co.uk\">https://wallisconsultancy.co.uk</a>\nThe source code: <a href=\"https://github.com/james-wallis/wallisconsultancy\">https://github.com/james-wallis/wallisconsultancy</a></p>\n<h2>What is EmailJS</h2>\n<p>In the previous blog I introduced EmailJS, a service designed to send emails on behalf of websites with no backend server, and added to the Wallis Consultancy React.js application that is being built.</p>\n<h2>What is reCaptcha</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>reCAPTCHA is a free service from Google that helps protect websites from spam and abuse.

Navigate to the Email Templates page and select “Create new template”, give it a name and an ID.

One of my modules was a Web Fundamentals course which explained the basics of HTML &#x26; CSS with a sprinkling of JavaScript at the end. I wanted a summer project with the aim that I would be a much better HTML and CSS developer next year when I was asked to build a web-based dashboard as a part of the Web Programming coursework.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/pztz2awi7nptq69pykhc.jpg\" alt=\"Original Wallis Consultancy website\">\n<em>The original Wallis Consultancy website</em></p>\n<p>The original website was written using in 2011 in HTML and CSS using a PHP backend. As of 2016 the design was outdated and was not responsive rendering it unusable for anyone on a device with a small screen. Over the summer I rewrote the site using HTML, CSS and the Bootstrap framework and gave it a PHP backend so that I could reuse certain aspects of the page and make a general layout. Given that it was my first professional website, I was pretty happy with the result. In 2018 I moved it from a GoDaddy server to a Docker container to make it cheaper to run and easier for me to maintain.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/60cw56z459foymy2v9vy.jpg\" alt=\"Current Wallis Consultancy website\">\n<em>The current Wallis Consultancy website</em></p>\n<p>It’s now 2020 and I have been requested to make changes to the website. While it can be said that it’s working perfectly in its current condition, adding new pages and subtle features are difficult due to its reliance on HTML. Additionally, my skillset has improved know that this site will benefit from my experience using Next.js, a React.js framework that specialises in building server rendered, SEO friendly sites. In addition, as uses a Bootstrap Template, it came with a lot of CSS and JavaScript that is unused and in no way optimised. Next.js does a nice job of minifying the JavaScript and Tailwind CSS, a CSS framework, will help to reduce the amount of CSS I need to create and remove anything that is unused.</p>\n<h2>Why Next.js</h2>\n<p>When a website is built using React.js the clients browser is required to run JavaScript and construct the page itself, this is bad for two reasons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There might be a few seconds before the website can be used by the client.  - Bad user experience.</li>\n<li>For SEO - although search engines are being improved to handle JavaScript applications there is no guarantee that the search bot will render the application correctly. For this reason it is still preferred to send static HTML to the client.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Next.js solves these problems by statically generating and server-rendering a React application meaning we can send rendered HTML to the client as opposed to large JavaScript files.</p>\n<p>Next.js has other noteworthy features such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automatic Code Splitting - Rendered pages only contain the JavaScript they need, rather than a single JavaScript file for all pages.</li>\n<li>Built in Routing - To create a new page, just add a file in the <code>pages</code> folder</li>\n<li>Prefetching - Using the <code>Link</code> component we can tell Next what pages the user is able to visit, Next responds by pre-fetching the content required for the page in the background so there is no load times between pages.</li>\n<li>A Next app can be exported to static HTML - This is a huge feature that was released in <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-3#next-gen-static-site-generation-ssg-support\">Next.js 9.3</a> websites to be run through Github pages.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\">Next.js</a></p>\n<h2>Why Tailwind CSS</h2>\n<p>Tailwind CSS describes itself as a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. It works by having an existing library of CSS classes that you can add to a React.js component using the <code>className</code> prop. To add a height of 100% you add the class <code>h-full</code> to the component, this is an improvement to giving a component a classname and then opening a CSS file to define what you want the class to do - it makes styling a component a fast process.</p>\n<p>For responsive sites, there exists the intuitive <code>{screen}:</code> prefix which makes it easy to control responsive classes, for a desktop all that is the <code>lg</code> prefix next to the styling e.g. <code>lg:h-full</code> .</p>\n<p>The default configuration can be overridden using a <code>tailwind.config.js</code> file and additional classes can be added to the framework so that there is never a need to use the  <code>style</code>  attribute.</p>\n<p>Finally, TailwindCSS.com has a search utility that makes finding a class name extremely easy. If you need to know how to use a border radius, you can search it on the website and within seconds make the change to your code. This means that there is nothing to learn when picking up Tailwind CSS for the first time as its so easy to find on their website.\n<img src=\"Rewriting%20HTMLCSS%20Bootstrap%20website%20in%20React%20using%20Next.js%20and%20hosting%20on%20Github%20Pages%20(1)/9C20D553-A94C-40D6-9A9C-1FC7CD366F00.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">Tailwind CSS - A Utility-First CSS Framework for Rapidly Building Custom Designs</a></p>\n<h2>The Plan</h2>\n<p>In the next few posts, I will rewrite wallisconsultancy.co.uk using Next.js and TailwindCSS in order to achieve the following goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make it easier to maintain</li>\n<li>Enhance the SEO using Next.js third-party libraries such as next-seo and next-image-optimizer</li>\n<li>Host on Github pages to save money</li>\n<li>Add a Recaptcha to reduce the amount of email spam received</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And I’ll do all this while ensuring that the look of the page stays the same - with a few subtle tweaks.</p>\n<h2>Round up</h2>\n<p>In this blog I introduced wallisconsultancy.co.uk and explained that over the next few blogs I am going to rebuild it using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.</p>\n"}]
