                                <li>Using the video tag we added a video that we made into our websites (a template website was given). The video had to be in the correct file type to work on the browser I was using (Chrome). </li>
                                <li>In the lecture we learned that different browsers use different file types. For example the .mov file type is patented by Apple and works on Safari, yet other file types may not. Due to this the HTML must include different files for one video, containing different file types.</li>
                                <li>Additionally we added an image to our website. We also added a style attribute so that the image would change to a different one depending on the size of the window open. </li>

                                <li>SVG type images are the best type of image to use on a website as they are extremely scalable without becoming pixelated but also because they take up a tiny amount of space on a server. </li>
                                <li>Additionally, in the lecture we learnt about the different colours that could be used on a website, or the Websafe Palette.</li>

                                <li>In the practical we used a process of "Reverse Identifying". This is a review process for existing websites that looks into the questions you will face when designing a new website.</li>

                                    <li>Why is it important?</li>
                                    <li>User centered approach to design.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>We found that good usability was centered around:</li>
                            <li class="removePoint">
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Clear Navigation</li>
                                    <li>Easy to learn interface</li>
                                    <li>Error Prevention</li>
                                    <li>Organised Layout</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Also touched on was how to organise our content.</li>
                            <li>We did a card sorting exercise in class. Each card had a different kind of amenity and we had to put them into groups based on a group vote. The purpose of this was to show us what went well together and how to categorise content on a website.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>This week we continued to learn about how Usability can affect websites.</li>
                            <li>This week we researched:</li>
                            <li class="removePoint">
                                <ul>
                                     <li>Navigation and Orientation</li>
                                     <li>Design of web pages</li>
                                     <li>Mobile Design</li>
                                     <li>Incorporating Usability</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>We were shown that websites should be laid out in such a way so that the user can build a mental map of how the content is laid out.</li>
                            <li>We were also told about media queries and responsive design, usually using columns.</li>
                            <li>The lecture also touched on usability mistakes such as neglecting user aims, mobile users and distracting images.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 onclick="toggle_visibility('05/02/16');"  class="weekDate"><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i>05/02/16 - <em>Accessibility</em></h3>
                        <ul id="05/02/16">
                            <li>During this weeks lecture we had a guest speaker who worked on the NHS's website</li>
                            <li>He informed us that we should take care to make our website easy to use for people with all disabilities</li>
                            <li>This included:</li>
                            <li class="removePoint">
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Making it easily read by a screen reader, for example using aria-labels on elements</li>
                                    <li>Choosing colours carefully as to not confuse the colour blind</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>When he taught us about colour choice, he switched between a yellow box, to a box that changed from red to green when sufficient text was entered. At this point, Rich, who is colour blind, pointed out that he didn't see the change at all.</li>
                            <li>In the practical we simulated impairment</li>
                            <li>This involved us wearing special glasses that changed our vision and enabled us to simulate using our websites as if we had eye issues.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>From the 12th of February right up to the due date for the website I focused all my time on finishing it.</li>
                            <li>This included me getting feedback from other coursemate and friends to make sure it was easy to navigate and read.</li>
                            <li>In this week I also added the finishing touches and uploaded it to my server to be handed in.</li>
