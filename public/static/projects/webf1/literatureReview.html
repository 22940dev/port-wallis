                                <h2>Sustainable Computing Literature Review</h2>
                                        <p>
                                                Computing in the 21st century must be sustainable (Bener, 2014). Many studies have been released supporting this view showing no single solution. Due to the variation, this review will focus on three main themes. These are: the changing of hardware in a product in order for it to be sustainable, the importance of reducing the energy used by hardware and finally the influence software has on the sustainability of the computer industry. Although the literature used may talk more broadly about the themes, this review employs their points to the topic of sustainable computing.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                                Until recent years there was no thought about the power consumption of machines or their environmental impacts (Hurson, 2013). This resulted in around 86% of the global primary energy demand being created using fossil fuels; a figure which is still rising (Abas, 2015). Other studies show that world oil production has peaked, making the requirement for sustainability greater (Cohen, 2009) (Simmons, 2007). Furthermore, studies claim that renewable and alternative energy sources can solve energy and climate issues (Abas, 2015). However, instead of creating green energy, decreasing the energy consumption in the computing industry should be a priority. In the UK the average household has 7.5 computer devices, equivalent to 4,648 kilowatt hours per year. In comparison Nigeria, a third world country, uses 570 kilowatt hours per household and has less than one device per household. This unfathomable difference prompted companies to take more care with what goes into their products.

                                                Microsoft achieved this in 2010 with the re-designed Xbox 360 Slim. They removed harmful brominated flame retardants and phthalates and found their environmentally friendly alternatives, creating more sustainable devices (Microsoft Environmental Sustainability Team, 2010), a move supported by various studies (Wit, 2002). Additionally surface mounting was introduced reducing the amount of components put into the device, eliminating many cable and making the Xbox smaller and cheaper. Instead the components were soldered directly onto the main printed circuit board.
                                        </p>

                                                The article showed evidence of Moore's Law being used to reduce the amount of energy consumed by an Xbox 360 by half of what its predecessor would have consumed. On the other hand, studies showed that in the same year only Sony-Erickson and Nokia obtained a green rating (Green Peace, 2010). This shows that companies over-emphasise their contribution to green computing and are not doing enough to be considered sustainable.
                                        </p>

                                                Energy usage is also a major factor of concern. Datacentres are depended on by mass-corporations and governments to store data securely. This results in datacentres consuming vast amounts of electricity to power the servers and fans in the building. Many studies have proven that the growth of cloud computing has increased the datacentres demand leading to over $30 billion being spent on datacentre power, the majority of a datacentres budget (Scramella, 2007) (Koomey, 2008) (Lin, 2013). Studies also show that a well optimized datacentre uses less energy than a datacentre which has not had energy usage as a factor when it was built (Bener, 2014).
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                                Furthermore, other studies suggest that the use of Virtual Machines in datacentres can decrease the energy consumption of servers, network equipment, and cooling systems by 2.5%, 18.8%, and 28.2% respectively (Esfandiarpoor, 2015). There are many Virtual Machines employed on one physical machine, making the physical machine efficiently utilised, this process also reduces the usage of more racks and routers in a datacentre.
                                        </p>

                                                The hardware in a datacentre must be kept at a steady temperature so it does not over heat, hence cooling is a major energy consumer in datacentres. Studies show that energy consumption can be limited by careful design of the datacentre, for example adding the ability to regulate temperature changes (Shiel, 2015) (Knight, 2009) and using plastic butchers curtains to keep the server's contained (Saran, 2013). The same study shows that a datacentre uses greater energy when its optimal temperature is not met, as the fans must do more work to achieve the optimal temperature.

                                                Mobile computing is the fastest growing form of computing to date. 90% of the America Population own a mobile phone, 64% of those own a smart phone, which studies refer to as computers, not merely mobile phones (Li, 2014) (Ahmed, 2014). The expanding industry has reduced energy usage in the computing industry as a whole because they are smaller than their fixed counterparts and contain less powerful hardware.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                                The ability for mobile devices to be small but powerful comes from the utilisation of Moore's law to create smaller and less power-hungry hardware. This process also keeps their cost to a satisfactory level. Due to Moore's Law, studies are now able to predict that 5G mobile data could be round the corner as the 5G transmitter can be created small enough to fit inside a mobile phone (Pierce, 2015).
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                                However, mobile devices have a short lifespan as many people decide to upgrade their phone as soon as they can, a process that renders their old phones obsolete (Rahmani, 2014) (Paiano, 2013). Paiano states that although 20 million PC units will be obsolete by 2016, 39 million mobile units will be obsolete in the same time frame. The reviews provide evidence that while mobile devices may be smaller and more energy efficient, they have a shorter life span than their PC equivalent. Paiano also states that the consumption of mobile devices cancels out the energy that they save from hardware changes.

                                                In conclusion the literature reviewed in this provides evidence that complete sustainable computing is far off.  Wit argued that hardware can be changed in order to make a product much more sustainable. This will help with consumption or energy during a products use and also ensure that it is easily recyclable when it is made redundant (Wit, 2002). However other studies have shown that purely reducing energy consumption by computer datacentres will make the computing industry substantially more sustainable. Scramella, Esfandiarpoor, Shiel all agree that datacentres use a vast amount of energy, being far from fully utilised (Scramella, 2007) (Esfandiarpoor, 2015) (Shiel, 2015). Additionally Musheer Ahmed agrees that energy consumption must be limited, focussing on the use of mobile devices as they use smaller hardware and less power than PCs (Ahmed, 2014).

                                        <p>
                                                Although there have been numerous studies around different areas of sustainable computing have been completed, further research should include the use of Moore's law to extend the life of mobile devices and also to reduce energy consumption in datacentre's. Applying it to these two areas will increase the sustainability of computing by a massive amount.
