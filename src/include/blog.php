                        <!-- <p><strong>Why blog?</strong><br> I am starting a blog on my site so that I can keep it relevant and keep anyone interested in me or my services up-to-date on what I have achieved.
                        Although the blog may appear rough on the edges in terms of writing, I am sure that the content will be 100% relevant on not only displaying my personality, but also my perseverance to learn.
                        I believe that blogging is the best way to do this as it means that I can keep a record of every achievement that I gain, no matter how little or insignificant.
                        For example, today I officially finished the website for Flowerpot Men. An extremely simple site that I created for a friend so that he is able to advertise his summer gardening in a professional way.</p>
                        <p><strong>Starting Goals?</strong><br>
                        Currently I have a few goals. The first is to start and finish a carefully thought out website worthy of the walliswebdevelopment.com domain. This is the name that I have selected to use for my website development/creation business.
                        Don't be fooled, however, if this business does not take off, I will still continue to update my current sites as the main goal that I hope to achieve from the business and also from university, is to gain as much knowledge as possible
                        around areas that interest me or are vital to the career path I choose to take. Of course I will advertise and push to sell websites as I would be extremely excited to add a website development business onto my CV to show off to future employers.
                        <br>I also have smaller goals to this (in some sense). I am aiming to learn how to code a dynamic site using PHP and MySQL, this goal is subject to change as I may find an even better way to code a dynamic site, but my current research has shown me that the two
                        technologies together are the best way to do it. In addition to this I aim to understand above the basics of ranking high in Search Engine Optimisation. I feel that this goal is a must due to the nature of my current career path as I understand that
                        there is no point in having a website that cannot be found on Google or any other search engine.</p>
                        <p><strong>First Sign Off</strong><br>So now that I have completed my first blog post I hope that any readers have a clear idea of my goals for this year and also what I hope to achieve from writing this blog. The aim is to keep this up so in a couple of months
                        I have a well detailed blog full of content that shows off what I have learnt.</p>
