                                            Currently, I am working towards my degree in Computer Science at the University of Portsmouth.
                                            I am in my Second Year after finishing the first year with exceptional gradings. My first year
                                            at University was an amazing experience as I am finally studying something that interests me and
                                            thus am excelling at all coursework given to me.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                          University introduced me to Programming which in my own nerdy way, I fell in love with instantly.
                                          By the end of the first term I had participated in my first educational competition, something that I had never dreamed I would attempt.
                                          In addition to this competition I took part in a Google Hashcode to get further experience in my field. Although my team did not perform well,
                                          it showed me what I need to learn and inspired me to keep learning through the summer, starting walliswebdesign.com in the process.

                                          I attended the Sixth Form at Ashlyns School during the years 2013 to 2015. While here I studied IT, Government &amp; Politics and History. I also did an Extended Project Qualification which saw me evaluate different ways
                                          to build a website, by getting someone to build it, building it yourself from scratch and learning the skills along the way, and then finally by using an online website builder.

                                        <p>
                                          The grades that I achieved are as follows:
                                          <ul>
                                            <li>ICT: A</li>

                                          I thoroughly enjoyed my years and sixth form and am extremely proud of the grades that I came away with.

                                            Martin's Pond is a small village pub but very popular for its fabulous food so it was a busy and challenging shift working as a waiter at all times. This job included running food and drinks and ensuring that all guests were happy which helped me to build my confidence and gain experience in building relationships with the guests - ensuring that customers enjoyed their experience in the restaurant was always my top priority. I also gained experience of dealing with a variety of guests - dealing with tricky situations at times.  Whilst out front, using my customer skills, I excelled at selling raffle tickets for charity events that the restaurant supported. This led to me being asked on many occasions to sell them on my shift as I was seen as an effective salesman!

                                            Once a week after school, I worked with the local Kumon club. My duties included teaching and helping mostly Primary and First School children Mathematics and English. This job taught me to be organised as my other tasks included marking the children's work and also recording the work that they had completed during the week. I only had a 2 hour period to accomplish all my tasks meaning that efficiency was key.

                                            School Work Experience at its head office in Slough. It lasted one week during which time I was given a task of making a presentation on the O2 project 'Think Big' which encouraged young people to become involved in technological advancement. I also learnt about how O2 stays online and how the backend (database) was set up. The week saw me meet lots of new people and interact with them in a professional, yet friendly way.
